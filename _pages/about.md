I am a Ph.D. candidate at the Department of Political Science at Aarhus University (Denmark), studying political extremism, violence against minority groups, and democratic norms more generally. I am particularly interested in the role of political institutions and experiences in their local environment in shaping citizens' perceptions of what is legitimate to do in a democracy. Currently, I investigate when citizens perceive attacks on minority groups and their rights as justified and under which conditions this translates into intolerant and extreme forms of behavior, specifically hate crimes.

As part of the [DEMNORM project](https://demnorm.github.io/), I explore the relevance of social norms for democratic stability and how this helps us to better understand and encounter the challenges that democracies face around the world. 

To investigate this, my research relies on diverse quantitative methods with a focus on causal inference. Therefore, I develop innovative (quasi-)experimental designs, looking at citizens' attitudes and behaviors.
