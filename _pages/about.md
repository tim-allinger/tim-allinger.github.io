I am an incoming Postdoctoral Researcher at the Chair of Comparative Politics and Empirical Democracy Research at the University of Zurich. My research lies at the intersection of Comparative Politics and Political Behavior, addressing the growing challenges contemporary democracies face. I study how political and societal conflicts evolve within and beyond the electoral arena, examining the full spectrum of political participation - ranging from conventional practices to extremist and antidemocratic expressions. I am particularly interested in how political institutions and experiences in citizens' local environments shape their perceptions of legitimate political action, with a particular emphasis on violence against minority groups. 

# As part of the [DEMNORM project](https://demnorm.github.io/), I explore the relevance of social norms for democratic stability and how this helps us to better understand and encounter the challenges that democracies face around the world. 

To investigate this, my research relies on diverse quantitative methods with a focus on causal inference. Therefore, I develop innovative (quasi-)experimental designs, looking at citizens' attitudes and behaviors.
