@proceedings{partisansurrogation,
 title = {Who Should Politicians Represent? How Winning an Election Influences Citizens' Views on Representation},
 author = {Allinger, Tim Lars},
status = {Conditionally Accepted at The Journal of Politics},
 preprint = {https://osf.io/preprints/osf/a9fc8},
 abstract = {Should elected politicians represent their own voters or all citizens, regardless of who they voted for? Though a fundamental question in representative democracies, we lack insights into citizens' perspectives on this tension despite their essential role in democratic stability and legitimacy. I argue that while there is generally strong support for the idea that an elected politician should represent all citizens in their constituency (partisan surrogation), this support diminishes markedly due to self-interested considerations once citizens find themselves on the winning side of an election. Relying on a regression discontinuity design in close district races across three German national elections, I present quasi-experimental evidence in line with this argument. The findings indicate that many citizens expect partisan surrogation when losing without being willing to concede that to others upon an election victory. This highlights the need for a more dynamic perspective when studying citizens' expectations of the representative system.},

@unpublished{nomadcamps,
 title = {Do Exclusionary Policies Increase Hate Crimes? Evidence from the Nomad Camps in Italy},
 author = {Allinger, Tim Lars},
 status = {Available upon request},
 abstract = {Hostility and hate crimes against immigrants and ethnic minorities are a persistent problem, which have surged again across Europe in recent years. Yet, the role of state policies in shaping such violence remains understudied. I argue that exclusionary policies targeting minority groups can legitimize hostility, increasing hate crimes not only against the targeted group but also against other minorities. To test this, I examine Italy’s nomad camps—institutionalized, mono-ethnic settlements for Sinti and Roma—using municipality-level hate crime data. Leveraging spatial spillover effects combined with an instrumental variable approach, I show that proximity to these camps increases hate crimes against individuals with a migration background. Notably, this effect extends beyond camp residents, suggesting a broader shift in intolerant actions rather than mere opportunity-driven violence. These findings highlight the consequences of exclusionary policies and underscore the state’s role in shaping intergroup relations, with implications for policymaking in societies grappling with rising anti-minority violence.}

@unpublished{demnorm,
 title = {How Citizens Perceive Others: The Role of Social Norms for Democracies},
 author = {Bischof, Daniel and Allinger, Tim Lars and Le Corre Juratic, Morgan and Frederiksen, Kristian Vrede Skaaning},
 preprint = {https://osf.io/preprints/osf/4qgh8},
 abstract = {Generations of political scientists seek to understand the relationship between citizens' democratic values and democratic stability. The key premise of this research tradition is that democratic societies live on a ``social consensus'' over a set of democratic values; a democratic norm. Yet, until today scholarship has neither carefully theorized the role of nor measured the social nature of this consensus. Building on research in social psychology, we conceptualize democratic norms as social norms: citizens may think that most people in democracies support its institutions (descriptive norm) and also that one ought to do so (injunctive norm). We then measure these perceptions across 14 countries using nationally representative surveys covering 31\% of the world's population. We find that citizens have a strong perception of social democratic norms; however, mostly on abstract forms of support. Using a vignette experiment we also reveal that respondents' preferences are conditional on their perception of social norms. Our research has important implications for research on democracy showcasing the role social norms play to craft democratic support in our societies.}

@unpublished{sdb,
 title = {Can Social Desirability Be Manipulated in Online Surveys?},
 author = {Bischof, Daniel and Allinger, Tim Lars and Le Corre Juratic, Morgan and Frederiksen, Kristian Vrede Skaaning},
preprint = {https://osf.io/preprints/osf/ew95m},
abstract = {Social scientists have long debated the extent to which social desirability bias affects online survey responses. We argue that the most promising way to measure it is through a global manipulation at the survey's outset. If effective, this approach allows researchers to (1) isolate social desirability from confounders, (2) verify manipulation success, and (3) assess effects across multiple outcomes. Using well-powered survey experiments in the United States and Denmark, both on online access panels and a student convenience sample, we provide the most comprehensive test of this approach to date. Our findings show this method is unreliable: some treatments fail to induce perceptions of being observed, while others succeed but do not alter responses known to be affected by social desirability bias. These results challenge existing approaches and suggest researchers should prioritize specific inferential goals over a universal solution. We conclude with recommendations for alternative methods.}
